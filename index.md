# Final Milestone
To sum up, I want to establish what I have now.
1.	I studied image processing and applied it
2.	I worked with the motors and connected them to the system
3.	I have a working project
4.	I found the best way for the power supply of the project

# Second Milestone
I had a different version of the power supply in this project. Firstly, I tried to power raspberry, motors, and ultrasonic sensors from the AA batteries. But, during long usage, I concluded that it is unstable and expensive (because isn’t rechargeable).
I ran into a lot of problems during the process of buying details. I am a Ukrainian who is temporarily staying in Turkey, which means I don’t know the language, and how ordering something is working here. When I ordered, I had a lot of problems. For instance, for the body of the robot, the shop didn’t send 1 screw and I had to put one motor on a scotch tape. Moreover, I needed to buy sandpaper to wider the place for the switcher of the power supply, because it was too small to fit it. And all of this I needed to describe to the support, who speaks Turkish. Etc., etc.

# First Milestone
During the first milestone I was working on image processing. It is important to find the range of the colors in HSV pallete that suits exactly your object. You can do this with this code.
